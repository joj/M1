# M1 Firmware

Firmware for the M1 NFC/RFID multi-protocol device, built on STM32H5.

## Overview

The M1 firmware provides support for:

- **NFC** (13.56 MHz)
- **LF RFID** (125 kHz)
- **Sub-GHz** (315–915 MHz)
- **Infrared** (IR transmit/receive)
- **Bluetooth** (BLE scan, advertise, GATT; via ESP32 co-processor)
- **WiFi** (AP scan, station/AP modes; via ESP32 co-processor)
- **Battery** monitoring
- **Display** (ST7586s ERC240160)
- **USB** (CDC, MSC)

## Hardware

- **MCU:** STM32H573VIT6 (32-bit, 2MB Flash, 100LQFP)
- **Hardware revision:** 2.x

See [HARDWARE.md](HARDWARE.md) for more details.

## Documentation

- **[User Manual](documentation/USER_MANUAL.md)** – tour of every new UI feature (start here)
- [Build Tool (mbt)](documentation/mbt.md) – Build with STM32CubeIDE or VS Code
- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) – Project structure
- [Development](DEVELOPMENT.md) – Development guidelines
- [OUI/BLE Device Identification](documentation/oui_database.md) – MAC vendor lookup and BLE fingerprinting on scan views
- [BLE GATT Deep-Probe](documentation/ble_gatt_probe.md) – Long-press OK on a scanned BLE device to read its DIS and walk its services
- [WiFi WPA-PSK Dictionary Attack](documentation/wifi_dict_attack.md) – Long-press OK on a scanned wifi AP to run an online dictionary attack
- [WiFi Handshake / PMKID Capture](documentation/wifi_handshake_capture.md) – Long-press OK → "Capture hand" → hashcat .22000 files on SD
- [Flipper IR compat + Mass Off](documentation/ir_flipper_compat.md) – Use the Flipper-IRDB, "TV-Be-Gone"-style Mass Off, export learned signals back to Flipper

## Building

**See [documentation/mbt.md](documentation/mbt.md) for full build instructions** (STM32CubeIDE and VS Code setup, extensions, and optional post-build CRC).

### Prerequisites

- **STM32CubeIDE 1.17+** (recommended), or  
- **VS Code** with ARM GCC 14.2, CMake Tools, Cortex-Debug, and Ninja, or
- **Linux** with ARM GCC toolchain and Ninja or
- **MacOS** with ARM GCC toolchain, CMake Tools, and Ninja

### Build steps

#### Linux
```bash
make
```

Output: `./artifacts/` (MonstaTek_M1_v0800.elf, .bin, .hex)

#### #STM32CubeIDE
Open the project and build in the IDE.

**VS Code:**  
1. Configure the project (e.g. `gcc-14_2_build-release` or `gcc-14_2_build-debug`)  
2. Build via the Build icon  

Output: `./out/build/gcc-14_2_build-release` (VS Code) or `./Release` (STM32CubeIDE)

#### MacOS
Get prerequisites
```bash
make setup
```
Build
```bash
make
```

Output: `./artifacts/`
